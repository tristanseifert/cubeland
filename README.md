The following dependencies are included as submodules:

- **[FastNoise2](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2)**: Generates noise patterns used in terrain generation.
    - First, change into the library directory and check out its submodules: `cd libs/fastnoise2 && git submodule update --init --recursive`
    - Then, build it: `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j16`
- **[glbinding v3](https://glbinding.org)**: C++ binding to OpenGL types and functions, autogenerated from GL spec. This is included in the libraries dir and needs to be built; to do this, run `cd libs/glbinding && mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=false .. && cmake --build . --config Release -j16`
